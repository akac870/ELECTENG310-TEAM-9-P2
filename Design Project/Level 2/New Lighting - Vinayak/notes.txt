2. Delete all existing lighting - done

	3a. change grid size to 1.2 X 0.6
4. Set LLF to 1. Project > maintenance plan method > All inclusive LLF - done
5. Set Correction factors for individual luminaires. (Correction factor
	overrides the LLF for a luminaire)
6. Set appropriates CRI for rooms that require appropriate lighting for viewing products.

Anthony recommendation:
- use U2 ETAP lighting due to efficacy.
- use low power direct lighting. But use more of them for better uniformity
- make sure to compare your working with AS/NZS 1680
- use 1/3 rule of thumb between luminance change across rooms and corridors
